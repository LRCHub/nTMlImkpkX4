# IRyS – Escalate

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Heart
Stops
Breathe
Out
Un-
Locked
Free me
ESCALATE
Spun out n' left for dead
Stranded with my regret and I couldn't forget
the words ringing in my head
Saying 'You're such a wreck'
If you say so, I guess I'm -
Headed toward the fire
My head is stuck in overdrive
Rammin through, straight into what they all said
I can't do
Ready to burn the tires
This is my desire
Get, Set, now drive!
Go hit the gas, don't hover the brakes
Do what it takes till they know your name
Steerin' yourself right toward your fate
Crash into it cause it's all yours to take
So ready up! No, don't contemplate
Can't waste your life there's just no time to
wait
You'll never break and it's no mistake
That you've got this far, don't you be afraid
Believe and
Escalate
Lagging behind the rest
I made every excuse for runnin' just on fumes
I dreamed I could be the best
I'll make it all come true, just wait and I'll
show you
Turn off the cruise control, forget about the
limits now
Oh I'm red-lined, I'm in drive, my RPM's on fire
Ready to burn the tires
This is my desire
Get, Set, now drive!
Go hit the gas, don't hover the brakes
Do what it takes till they know your name
Steerin' yourself right toward your fate
Crash into it cause it's all yours to take
So ready up! No, don't contemplate
Can't waste your life there's just no time to
wait
You'll never break and it's no mistake
That you've got this far, don't you be afraid
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
I'll escalate it
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
Ahhhh woo!
Above the limit, feel my heart rising
Drifting away I'm flying far, my engines burning
Hotter than fire itself
Push it more
Excel all for myself
And I'll yell
Go hit the gas, don't hover the brakes
Do what it takes till they know your name
Steerin' yourself right toward your fate
Crash into it cause it's all yours to take
So ready up! No, don't contemplate
Can't waste your life there's just no time to
wait
You'll never break and it's no mistake
That you've got this far, don't you be afraid
Hit the highway
Believe and
Escalate
